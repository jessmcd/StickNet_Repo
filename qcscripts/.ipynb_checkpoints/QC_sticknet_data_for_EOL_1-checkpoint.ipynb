    "* This script requires data in the following format:\n",

    "    etc. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* You need to pass the MainDirectory path to the \"directory\" variable.\n",
    "  Check all of your data files. If anything is only 58 bytes in size, delete it. This is just a header and no data,     and it will error if you run it through this script.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "* This script will create a new directory: /MainDirectory/DeploymentName/reformat/\n",
    "  and put all QC'd files there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* This script must be in the same directory as a folder called \"QC_flagged_data\"\n",
    "  If you want to change this, edit the \"flagged_file\" variable, which is the filepath to  \"/QC_flagged_data/flagged_DeploymentName.txt\". The flagged file will hold all the lines of data that were flagged by the QC process, which can help determine if there is a \"problem sticknet\".\n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    "* If something goes wrong in the middle of proecessing, you can move the data that was already processed out of the raw folder and run again. The flagged file will not get overwritten as all new data is appended to the bottom. If you need to start over, delete the flagged file and reformat directory and run again. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### This script performs several tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fixing Wind Direction: It replaces the header compass heading with the footer compass heading, which tends to be more accurate. If there is no footer, the header is kept. The raw WD values are based on the header, so if the footer is different, this difference is subtracted from the orginal WD data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. QCing the data: Each of the following variables: T, RH, P, and WS, are checked for any \"crazy\" values. There are two flags, the TFLAG (for the thermo variables T, RH, and P) and the WFLAG (WS). 0 = good, 1 = bad. A 10-pt boxcar is used to make a smoothed version of the data. The raw data and smoothed data are subtracted, and if this difference is larger than the values set in qcvals, that data is flagged. I believe these values are based on the sensor specs, but I'm not totally sure. They have been used for 10 years though, so I'm not changing them. This flagged data is then written out into the reformat directory. *** UPDATE MAY 2020: the Tflag is also raised if RH exceeds 100 % ***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flagging the flagged data...: if a variable gets flagged, then that row of data is printed in the QC_flagged_data directory. Each of the QC'd variables are printed here along with the smoothed value they were compared against. The flags are also printed here. Each deployment directory in MainDirectory gets its own flagged data file, regardless of how many different sticknets are within (the file name which has the sticknet ID in it is included in each row of flagged data)\n"
