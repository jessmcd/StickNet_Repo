  the time zone, the directory that holds the realtime data, and the directory that holds all the created figures. 


### Dependencies:

  - boto3
  - pandas
  - datetime
  - py-art
  - metpy
  - scipy 
  - cartopy
  - netCDF4
  - cmocean
  - StickNet object class
  
  Everything else is basic python (numpy, matplotlib, math, etc. )
